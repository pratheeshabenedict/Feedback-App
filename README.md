The user interface is styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design. Users can provide feedback by selecting one of three options — Good, Neutral, or Bad — and view real-time statistics including total feedback count and average score. This project is ideal for learning and showcasing fundamental front-end development skills with React.
